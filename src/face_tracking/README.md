# Face Tracking

To use the face tracking, we need to install additional dependancies.

If you're on Windows, you need to have installed Visual Studio with C++ build tools
see [this guide](./installing_vs_build_tools.md) on how to install them.

Then in the CLI in the face_tracking directory run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
