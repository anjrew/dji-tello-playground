# Example Exercises

This folder contains a collection of sample scripts and exercises designed to help you get started with and understand the functionality of the DJI Tello playground. These examples demonstrate how to use various components of the projectâ€”from basic drone commands to more advanced features like computer vision integrations.

Make sure to always execute the scripts from the `src` directory to ensure proper module imports and file references.

The numbered exercises are ordered from basic to advanced, with each script building upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones. Feel free to explore and modify the scripts to suit your needs or experiment with new ideas.

The other scripts are more advaned and demonstrate additional capabilities of the Tello drone, such as face tracking, object detection, and autonomous flight.
