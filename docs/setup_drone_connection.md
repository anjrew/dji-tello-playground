## Setup Drone Connection

To interact with the drone, you must first establish a WiFi connection:

1. Power on your DJI Tello drone by quickly pressing and releasing the main power button.
2. Look at the aircraft status lights. It should go though the following sequence:
   - Alternating red and yellow: The drone is turning on and performing self diagnostic tests.
   - Yellow blinking quickly: The drone is not connected but is ready to connect to a WiFi network.
   - The drone will only stay in the waiting state for a short while. Try restarting the done if it becomes unreachable why turning on and off again
3. Connect your computer to the drone's WiFi network.
