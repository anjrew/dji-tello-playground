# Setting up the Environment

See below the three different recommended ways for setting up your environment. 
Some options suit some platforms better. For example the dev container option only works on Linux

# Code Editor Setup

You can use any code editor you like but we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor. It is a lightweight, open-source code editor with a wide range of features and extensions that make it a popular choice among developers.

You can download Visual Studio Code from [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Python Environment Setup


## Option 1: Using a Virtual Python Environment

### Dependencies

Before starting, ensure you have Python 3.11 higher.

You can download from [here for Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nrwmjp3717k?hl=en-US&gl=US) version or the official site [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/) for other platforms.

Make sure the python path is added to the system environment variables. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
``` 

If no version is displayed, you may need to add the Python path to the system environment variables. Follow this guide on how to do this on [Windows](https://medium.com/@viknesh2798/how-to-fix-the-issues-while-using-python-command-in-the-command-prompt-ba56d9018c5f)


### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
   
Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This command creates a new virtual environment named venv in your project directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment:
On Windows, run:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux, run:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You'll notice the command prompt changes to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

### 2. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs all the required Python packages.
Remember to activate the virtual environment each time you work on this project.

## Option 2: Using a Dev Container with VS Code (Linux Only)

Alternatively, you can use a dev container with Visual Studio Code for a pre-configured development environment. 

This option is currently only verified to work on Linux systems.

1. Install Docker on your system.
2. Install the Remote - Containers extension in VS Code.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code.
4. Click on the button in the lower-left corner of the VS Code window and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".

This will build and start the dev container, providing you with a ready-to-use development environment.

## Option 3: Using Conda

Conda is a powerful tool that allows for the management of packages, dependencies, and environments. Its use is not limited to Python projects, as it can manage packages from any language.

### Dependencies
Before starting, ensure you have installed [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) or Anaconda

1. **Create a Conda Environment**
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.11
```

Replace myenv with your desired environment name. This command creates a new Conda environment named myenv with Python 3.11. As a recommendation you could name the environment tellodrone.

2. **Activate the Conda Environment**
Activate the Conda environment by running:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```
You'll notice the command prompt changes to indicate that the Conda environment is active.

3. **Install Dependencies**
With the Conda environment activated, you can install project dependencies. If you have a requirements.txt file, you can use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Remember to activate the Conda environment each time you work on this project.
